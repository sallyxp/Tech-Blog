# Tech-Blog
This is a project to create a Tech Blog - a Content Management System (CMS) style blog site built to publish articles, blog posts, thoughts and opinions.  It is created, as tasked, using the Model-View-Controller paradigm.  The system is created using node.js, handlebars.js, Sequelize and mySQL2.


## *MVC Model-View-Controller* 
MVC is short for Model, View, and Controller. MVC is a popular way of organizing code. The big idea behind MVC is that each section of your code has a purpose, and those purposes are different. Some of your code holds the data of your app, some of your code makes your app look nice, and some of your code controls how your app functions.

MVC is a way to organize your code’s core functions into their own, neatly organized boxes. This makes thinking about your app, revisiting your app, and sharing your app with others much easier and cleaner.

The parts of MVC
Model: Model code typically reflects real-world things. This code can hold raw data, or it will define the essential components of your app. For instance, if you were building a To-do app, the model code would define what a “task” is and what a “list” is – since those are the main components of a todo app. View: View code is made up of all the functions that directly interact with the user. This is the code that makes your app look nice, and otherwise defines how your user sees and interacts with it. Controller: Controller code acts as a liaison between the Model and the View, receiving user input and deciding what to do with it. It’s the brains of the application, and ties together the model and the view
